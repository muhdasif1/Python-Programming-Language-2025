# What is a Computer?

A **computer** is an **electronic machine** that processes data and performs tasks according to instructions (**programs**).


## In Simple Terms

- **Input** → Data you give it  
- **Processing** → CPU & memory work on the data  
- **Output** → Results you see, hear, or use  
- **Storage** → Keeps data for future use  

## Examples of Computers

- 💻 **Laptop** → Used for study or work  
- 📱 **Smartphone** → A small but powerful computer  
- 🖥️ **Supercomputer** → Used in science, weather forecasting, AI, etc.

# What is Programming?

**Programming** is the process of creating a set of instructions that a computer can follow to perform specific tasks.  
These instructions are written in a **programming language** such as Python, Java, or C++.  

Programming allows humans to communicate with computers and build applications, websites, games, and even artificial intelligence systems.  

## Key Points

- Programming = **Giving instructions to a computer**  
- Done using **programming languages**  
- Helps automate tasks, solve problems, and create software  
- Used in every field: **web, mobile, AI, data science, robotics, business software, and more**  


## How Programming Works

1. **Write Code** → The programmer writes instructions in a chosen language (e.g., Python).  
2. **Compile/Interpret** → The code is translated into machine language that the computer understands.  
3. **Execute** → The computer carries out the instructions step by step.  
4. **Output** → The result is shown to the user (text, sound, images, etc.).

## Example in Python

```python
# Simple Python program to add two numbers
a = 5
b = 3
sum = a + b
print("The sum is:", sum)
