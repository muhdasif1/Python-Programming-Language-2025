### **What is Programming?**
**Programming** is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are written in a **programming language** and are used to:
- Solve problems
- Automate tasks
- Build applications (like websites, games, mobile apps, and more)

In simple terms, programming is how you **talk to computers** and tell them what to do.

### 🐍 **What is Python?**
**Python** is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, and **general-purpose** programming language. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**.

Python is popular because it's:
- Easy to read and write (its syntax is close to English)
- Versatile (used in many fields like web development, data science, automation, etc.)

### **Features of Python**
1. **Simple Syntax** – Easy to learn, even for beginners.
2. **Interpreted Language** – No need to compile; Python code runs line-by-line.
3. **Dynamically Typed** – You don’t need to declare variable types.
4. **Object-Oriented** – Supports classes and objects.
5. **Large Standard Library** – Comes with many built-in modules.
6. **Cross-Platform** – Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
7. **Extensive Community Support** – Lots of tutorials, forums, and third-party libraries.
8. **Free and Open Source** – You can use and modify it freely.
