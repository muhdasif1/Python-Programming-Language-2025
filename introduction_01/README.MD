# What is Python Programming
Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** that’s known for being **easy to learn and read**. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**.

Here’s a quick breakdown:

**Key Features:**

* **Readable syntax:** Its code looks almost like English, making it great for beginners.
* **Interpreted:** You don’t need to compile it — Python runs your code line by line.
* **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
* **Versatile:** Used in web development, data science, AI, machine learning, automation, and more.
* **Huge community:** Millions of users, tons of free libraries and frameworks (like Django, Flask, NumPy, TensorFlow, etc.).

# How Python works

### 1. **You write the code**

You write Python code in a **text editor or IDE** (like VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE).
Example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

### 2. **The Python Interpreter reads it**

Python is an **interpreted language**, meaning it doesn’t need to be “compiled” first.
Instead, a special program called the **Python interpreter** reads and runs your code **line by line**.

---

### 3. **Converts code to machine language**

The interpreter converts your code into a form the computer understands — **bytecode**, and then into **machine code** (0s and 1s).
This is how your computer actually performs the tasks you write in Python.

---

### 4. **The program runs**

Once translated, Python tells your computer what to do — for example, display text, do math, or control a robot!

---

### Example

```python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)
```

Python reads this code line by line
Adds 5 + 3
Prints **8**
