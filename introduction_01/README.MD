# What is Python Programming
Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** that’s known for being **easy to learn and read**. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**.


**Key Features:**

* **Readable syntax:** Its code looks almost like English, making it great for beginners.
* **Interpreted:** You don’t need to compile it — Python runs your code line by line.
* **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
* **Versatile:** Used in web development, data science, AI, machine learning, automation, and more.
* **Huge community:** Millions of users, tons of free libraries and frameworks (like Django, Flask, NumPy, TensorFlow, etc.).

# How Python works

### 1. **You write the code**

You write Python code in a **text editor or IDE** (like VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE).
Example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

### 2. **The Python Interpreter reads it**

Python is an **interpreted language**, meaning it doesn’t need to be “compiled” first.
Instead, a special program called the **Python interpreter** reads and runs your code **line by line**.

---

### 3. **Converts code to machine language**

The interpreter converts your code into a form the computer understands — **bytecode**, and then into **machine code** (0s and 1s).
This is how your computer actually performs the tasks you write in Python.

---

### 4. **The program runs**

Once translated, Python tells your computer what to do — for example, display text, do math, or control a robot!

---

### Example

```python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)
```

Python reads this code line by line
Adds 5 + 3
Prints **8**

---
 **comments** 
 are used to explain your code and make it easier to understand. They are ignored by the Python interpreter — meaning they don’t affect how the program runs.

There are **two main types of comments**:

---

### 1. **Single-line comment**

Use the `#` symbol before your comment.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")  # You can also add a comment at the end of a line
```

---

### 2. **Multi-line comment**

Python doesn’t have a specific multi-line comment syntax, but you can use triple quotes `'''` or `"""` to write multi-line comments (commonly used for documentation).

```python
'''
This is a multi-line comment.
You can write multiple lines here.
'''
print("Python comments example")
```

OR

```python
"""
This is also a multi-line comment.
It works the same way.
"""
```

---
**Comments are super helpful when:**

* Explaining what a piece of code does
* Temporarily disabling code during debugging
* Writing documentation for functions and classes
