# Python Operators Demonstration

This project contains a complete demonstration of **Python operators** with examples, including:

* Arithmetic Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Bitwise Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Identity Operators
* Logical Operators
* Membership Operators

Each section shows how the operator works, prints results, and demonstrates different ways to store and display output (using variables, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and f-strings).

---

## 1. Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform basic mathematical operations like:

* Addition (`+`)
* Subtraction (`-`)
* Multiplication (`*`)
* Division (`/`)
* Floor Division (`//`)
* Modulus (`%`)
* Exponentiation (`**`)

The code demonstrates calculations using variables, lists, dictionaries, and formatted print statements.

---

## 2. Assignment Operators

Assignment operators modify the value of a variable and reassign it:

* `+=`
* `-=`
* `*=`
* `/=`
* `%=`
* `**=`
* `//=`

Each example updates the variable and prints the new value.

---

## 📌 3. Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators work on the binary level:

* AND (`&`)
* OR (`|`)
* XOR (`^`)
* NOT (`~`)
* Left Shift (`<<`)
* Right Shift (`>>`)

Binary representation using `bin()` is also shown.

---

## 4. Comparison Operators

These compare two values:

* Equal (`==`)
* Not Equal (`!=`)
* Greater Than (`>`)
* Less Than (`<`)
* Greater or Equal (`>=`)
* Less or Equal (`<=`)

Results are also stored in lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

---

## 5. Identity Operators

Identity operators check memory identity:

* `is`
* `is not`

Examples show how Python checks if two variables point to the same object.

---

## 6. Logical Operators

Logical operators combine conditions:

* `and`
* `or`
* `not`

Includes comparisons, mixed types, and combined logical statements.

---

## 7. Membership Operators

Check if a value exists in:

* Lists
* Strings
* Dictionaries (keys only)

Examples show usage of:

* `in`
* `not in`
