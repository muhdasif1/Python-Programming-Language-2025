# üêç Introduction to Python Programming

---

### **What is Programming?**
**Programming** is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are written in a **programming language** and are used to:
- Solve problems
- Automate tasks
- Build applications (like websites, games, mobile apps, and more)

In simple terms, programming is how you **talk to computers** and tell them what to do.

### üìå What is Python?

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and flexibility. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including:

* Procedural programming
* Object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Functional programming

Its clean syntax and dynamic typing make it ideal for beginners, while its powerful libraries and frameworks make it popular among professionals.

### Why Learn Python?

Python is one of the most popular and in-demand programming languages in the world. Here's why:

* **Easy to Learn and Use**: Python syntax is simple and resembles English, making it beginner-friendly.
* **Versatile**: Used in web development, data science, AI, automation, game development, IoT, and more.
* **Community Support**: A massive community means tons of tutorials, forums, and third-party libraries.
* **Cross-platform**: Python runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and even mobile devices.

### What are Data Types in Python?

**Data types in Python** define the **kind of value** a variable can hold. Python is a **dynamically typed** language, which means you don‚Äôt need to declare the data type ‚Äî Python figures it out automatically when you assign a value.

---

### Why Are Data Types Important?

Data types help Python:

* Understand what kind of operations can be performed
* Allocate memory
* Avoid errors during execution

---

### Built-in Data Types in Python

Here are the main categories of data types in Python:

#### 1. **Numeric Types**

| Type      | Description                     | Example      |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `int`     | Integer (whole number)          | `x = 10`     |
| `float`   | Floating-point number (decimal) | `x = 3.14`   |
| `complex` | Complex number                  | `x = 2 + 3j` |



#### 2. **Text Type**

| Type  | Description          | Example       |
| ----- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| `str` | String of characters | `x = "Hello"` |



#### 3. **Sequence Types**

| Type    | Description                   | Example         |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| `list`  | Ordered, mutable collection   | `x = [1, 2, 3]` |
| `tuple` | Ordered, immutable collection | `x = (1, 2, 3)` |
| `range` | Sequence of numbers           | `x = range(5)`  |



#### 4. **Mapping Type**

| Type   | Description                  | Example                |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `dict` | Key-value pairs (like a map) | `x = {"name": "Asif"}` |



#### 5. **Set Types**

| Type        | Description                | Example                |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `set`       | Unordered, unique elements | `x = {1, 2, 3}`        |
| `frozenset` | Immutable version of set   | `x = frozenset({1,2})` |



#### 6. **Boolean Type**

| Type   | Description                   | Example    |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| `bool` | Logical values (`True/False`) | `x = True` |



#### 7. **None Type**

| Type       | Description                        | Example    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `NoneType` | Represents "nothing" or "no value" | `x = None` |



### Example: Check Type of a Variable

```python
x = 19
print(type(x))   # <class 'int'>

x = "Asif"
print(type(x))   # <class 'str'>
```


### Summary Table

| Category | Data Types                |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Numeric  | `int`, `float`, `complex` |
| Text     | `str`                     |
| Sequence | `list`, `tuple`, `range`  |
| Mapping  | `dict`                    |
| Set      | `set`, `frozenset`        |
| Boolean  | `bool`                    |
| None     | `NoneType`                |

### **Comments in Python**

#### What is a Comment?

A **comment** is a line in a Python program that is **ignored by the interpreter**. Comments are used to explain code, make it more readable, and help developers understand the purpose of the code.

---

### **Types of Comments in Python**

#### 1. **Single-line Comment**

* Starts with the `#` symbol.
* Anything after `#` is not executed.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This is an inline comment
```

---

#### 2. **Multi-line Comment**

Python doesn‚Äôt have a built-in multi-line comment syntax, but you can use:

##### Option A: Multiple `#` lines

```python
# This is a multi-line
# comment using several
# hash symbols
```

##### Option B: Triple quotes (used like comments)

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment
using triple double quotes.
"""
```

Or:

```python
'''
This is another
multi-line comment
using triple single quotes.
'''
```

These are technically **multi-line strings**, but they‚Äôre ignored if not assigned.

---

### **Why Use Comments?**

* To explain what the code is doing
* To make complex code easier to understand
* To temporarily disable parts of code during testing
* To leave notes or reminders (e.g., TODO)

---

### üìù Comment Best Practices

‚úÖ Use comments to explain **why**, not just what.

‚úÖ Keep comments **clear and concise**.

‚ùå Avoid unnecessary comments that repeat the code.
