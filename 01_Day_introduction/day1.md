### Why Python ?
It is a programming language which is very close to human language and because of that, it is easy to learn and use. Python is used by various industries and companies (including Google). It has been used to develop web applications, desktop applications, system administration, and machine learning libraries. Python is a highly embraced language in the data science and machine learning community. I hope this is enough to convince you to start learning Python. Python is eating the world and you are killing it before it eats you.
