## 🐍 Introduction to Python Programming

### 📌 What is Python?

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and flexibility. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including:

* Procedural programming
* Object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Functional programming

Its clean syntax and dynamic typing make it ideal for beginners, while its powerful libraries and frameworks make it popular among professionals.

### 1: What are Data Types in Python?

**Data types in Python** define the **kind of value** a variable can hold. Python is a **dynamically typed** language, which means you don’t need to declare the data type — Python figures it out automatically when you assign a value.

---

### Why Are Data Types Important?

Data types help Python:

* Understand what kind of operations can be performed
* Allocate memory
* Avoid errors during execution

---

### Built-in Data Types in Python

Here are the main categories of data types in Python:

---

#### 1. **Numeric Types**

| Type      | Description                     | Example      |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `int`     | Integer (whole number)          | `x = 10`     |
| `float`   | Floating-point number (decimal) | `x = 3.14`   |
| `complex` | Complex number                  | `x = 2 + 3j` |

---

#### 2. **Text Type**

| Type  | Description          | Example       |
| ----- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| `str` | String of characters | `x = "Hello"` |

---

#### 3. **Sequence Types**

| Type    | Description                   | Example         |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| `list`  | Ordered, mutable collection   | `x = [1, 2, 3]` |
| `tuple` | Ordered, immutable collection | `x = (1, 2, 3)` |
| `range` | Sequence of numbers           | `x = range(5)`  |

---

#### 4. **Mapping Type**

| Type   | Description                  | Example                |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `dict` | Key-value pairs (like a map) | `x = {"name": "Asif"}` |

---

#### 5. **Set Types**

| Type        | Description                | Example                |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `set`       | Unordered, unique elements | `x = {1, 2, 3}`        |
| `frozenset` | Immutable version of set   | `x = frozenset({1,2})` |

---

#### 6. **Boolean Type**

| Type   | Description                   | Example    |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| `bool` | Logical values (`True/False`) | `x = True` |

---

#### 7. **None Type**

| Type       | Description                        | Example    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `NoneType` | Represents "nothing" or "no value" | `x = None` |

---

### Example: Check Type of a Variable

```python
x = 19
print(type(x))   # <class 'int'>

x = "Asif"
print(type(x))   # <class 'str'>
```

### Summary Table

| Category | Data Types                |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Numeric  | `int`, `float`, `complex` |
| Text     | `str`                     |
| Sequence | `list`, `tuple`, `range`  |
| Mapping  | `dict`                    |
| Set      | `set`, `frozenset`        |
| Boolean  | `bool`                    |
| None     | `NoneType`                |
