### Introduction

### what is Python?
Python is a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. It is an open source, interpreted, objected-oriented programming language. Python was created by a Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum. The name of the Python programming language was derived from a British sketch comedy series, Monty Python's Flying Circus. The first version was released on February 20, 1991.

### Why Python ?
It is a programming language which is very close to human language and because of that, it is easy to learn and use. Python is used by various industries and companies (including Google). It has been used to develop web applications, desktop applications, system administration, and machine learning libraries. Python is a highly embraced language in the data science and machine learning community. I hope this is enough to convince you to start learning Python. Python is eating the world and you are killing it before it eats you.

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in **1991**.

### Key Features of Python:

* **Easy to Read and Write:** Its syntax is clean and looks like plain English.
* **Interpreted Language:** You don’t need to compile code; it runs directly.
* **Dynamically Typed:** No need to declare variable types.
* **Versatile:** Used in web development, data science, machine learning, AI, automation, game development, and more.
* **Huge Community:** Lots of free libraries, tutorials, and support.
* **Cross-platform:** Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.

### Example Code:

```python
# Hello World in Python
print("Hello, World!")
```
